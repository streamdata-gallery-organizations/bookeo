      summary: Find available slots matching given search parameters
      description: |-
        Create a search for available slots that match the given search parameters.
         Note that there are two different searches possible, /availability/slots and /availability/matchingslots (this endpoint).
         The former simply shows the number of available seats for each available slot. The latter (this one) takes as input the participant numbers, and shows the slots that are available for those numbers, and an estimate of the price.
         Parameters include product code, number of people and options.
         The successful response also contains a "Location" HTTP header, which can be invoked to navigate the results of the search.

         It is possible to filter by time booked and/or time of the last change.
         To filter by time booked, the parameters startTime and endTime are required.
         To filter by last time changed, the parameters lastUpdatedStartTime and lastUpdatedEndTime are required.
         It is possible to filter by both at the same time. At least one of the two filters must be used.
         <p/>
         It is further possible to filter by product id.
         <p/>
         Do not use this method to periodically poll for new/changed bookings. Use webhooks (see API general documentation) instead.

         Make sure to not leave many holds around. In any case, holds are deleted automatically after a fixed time from creation.
         Note that when creating a hold, the customer field of the booking can be missing, in which case Bookeo will assume a default customer coming from the same country as the account.

         - fixed are products with a fixed schedule and a given number of seats. Ex a group tour, a class, a workshop
         - fixedCourse are fixed products that are defined as a course, i.e. comprise of a series of dates
         - flexibleTime are products that describe private appointments, i.e. when one booking uses one resource (teacher, consultant, etc)

         Although Bookeo applies a minimum amount of caching, it is recommended to cache these results for 10-15 minutes to improve the performance of your application, as product settings change rarely.

         For webhook with domain "bookings" and type "deleted", the notification will be sent whether the booking is canceled or completely deleted.
         Users can delete bookings by, for example, deleting their associated customer.
         Also note that these "bookings" "deleted" notifications are sent even for bookings in the past.
